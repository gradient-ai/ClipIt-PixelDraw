## Creating your first Gradient Workflow for classifying the Iris dataset

This tutorial is meant to be used in conjunction with the docs article at --insert url later--. Users should leave this tutorial with a basic understanding of creating and using Gradient Workflows using the Gradient CLI.

### Usage

To do this tutorial, you need an account with Gradient. If you want to modulate the Workflow in anyway, fork this repo and make edits to the YAML or .py files.

`git clone https://github.com/gradient-ai/iris-workflow-demo`

### Next Steps: 

It is recommended that you move onto the following tutorial after completing this one:  [End-to-end example: Deep Learning Recommenders in TensorFlow](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/tutorials-list/end-to-end-example)
